Hopefully this project gets completed.. lol

This project is not completed. I am able to manage resources, but was unable to implement the deadlock algorithm

Last time I did not implement deadlock detection and recovery. Now it can: 
- properly detect a deadlock 
- release the resource of a process as a part of deadlock recovery
